# HOW TO REMOVE ENVIRONMENT?

This guide describes steps necessary to destoy basic infrastructure for Kubernetes-based environment
on a pair of AWS accounts (operations and application).


## STEPS:

1. [JenkinsX] Run Kubernetes_Destroy job to remove application cluster

2. [Jenkins Core-Infra] Run Kubernetes_Destroy job remove operation cluster

3. [Dev-host] Remove Jenkins Core-infra with terraform command

3.1 Login with ec2-user to dev-host:

3.3 [ec2-user@ip-10-6-39-55 jenkins-core-infra]$ terraform plan -input=false -destroy -var-file=../terraform.tfvars

3.2 [ec2-user@ip-10-6-39-55 ~]$ cd ~/terraform/bmw-tf-aws-product-domain-maps-env-test/operations/eu-central-1/jenkins-core-infra

4. [Operation_aws_account console] Destroy CF stack

  Info:


Terraform acquires a state lock to protect the state from being written
by multiple users at the same time. Please resolve the issue above and try
again. For most commands, you can disable locking with the "-lock=false"
flag, but this is not recommended.
